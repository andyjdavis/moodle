=== 2.6.0 ===
* The class core_grade_external in grade/externallib.php has been renamed to core_grading_external.
  grade/externallib.php is concerned with the grading API not the grades API.
  The change was necessary to avoid a duplicate class name with core_grade_external in lib/grade/externallib.php.
